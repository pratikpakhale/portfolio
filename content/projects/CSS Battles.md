Clash of CSS is a platform where you can compete with other developers in CSS Battles. You can also create your own battles and challenge other developers.
Currently I am trying to build an umbreally SaaS for this project, the frontend is open source and you can contribute to it.
The results are 100% match to the results of the [original](https://cssbattles.dev).
